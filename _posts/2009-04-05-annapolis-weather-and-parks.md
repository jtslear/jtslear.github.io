So today was once again another beautiful day here in the city of Annapolis.  Yesterday was bright, sunny, warm, with a touch of heavy wind.  Today, even better with just a slight touch of breeze.  I chose the time to take myself and explore one of the parks that is around this city.  I cruised through [Quiet Waters Park](http://www.friendsofquietwaterspark.org).  A nice sized park with plenty of parking in different areas and a couple of areas in which the onion grass rustles in the wind.  There are a couple of gazebos and shelters for huge get togethers as well as a nice kids playground for all the youngsters to gather in groups to challenge the parents ability to keep thier children from having too much fun.

Something that sets this park off is the fact that there are no sporting grounds at all.  So it is more for the families at heart that just want to get away from nearly everything as well as the retired who don't want to deal with the sweaty bodies of humans running around.  During winter they have an ice skating rink.

I dropped by [Potbelly's](http://www.potbelly.com) to pick up a fantastic lunch. A cute girl works there, she did step two of the sandwich process. They have a really cool website. I then floated on over to [Art Stuff Inc.](http://www.artthingsinc.com) They have a not so cool website, but are in a cool location. Apparently I've left all my drawing stuff at the crib back in VA.  Bummer.  I then drove around the park, outside of it checking out the neighbourhood.  I already forget what the neighbourhood is called, but they have a private beach.  And the shoreline is close in general making a very nice view for some.

I then turned into the park, found my place to park, then parked my butt on a towell and delved into reading LDAP; something I've been doing since I've started my new job...  I then whipped out my creative side and picked up some sun on half of both my arms while drawing out some random picture.  It's not finished.  But when it is, I'll throw it up here.  Then I can excersise my ability to have graphics on this site!  MMMMM the posibilities of having more stuff.  Until next time.  Have some fun in the sun.
