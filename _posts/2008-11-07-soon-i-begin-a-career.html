<p>Just the other day I was offered a job!  Soon I will be making the finalizations of the scene which I currently live in now.  And soon the next scene will take to the stage!  This will bring immence change in my life as I will be making a move to a much larger area.  Annapolis Maryland to be exact.  I'm currently looking for housing and more so way to excited that I'm starting so soon.</p>
<p>I'm taking the position of a System Administrator at a company called InforMed-LLC.  They are a Health Care Solutions provider for many companies.  They are a rather small company but growing.  This is an awesome oppurtunity for me and if you can see my face expression you can definately tell how ecstatic I am about this change in life.</p>
<p>I've been waiting a long time for a job offer.  Now I will move on, and ponder the future.  Now I shall see where my life takes me.</p>
