I created a small powershell script to roll through all security groups in active directory.

[github.com/jtslear/get_ad_group_memberships](https://github.com/jtslear/get_ad_group_memberships)

Believe it or not, I find this difficult to google. Plenty of results to find a list of what a member is of, but not many that would display list of groups with each user that is assigned to it!

It isn't pretty. And by no means do I know powershell at all. But it was pretty quick. Note the read me! Enjoy.
