<p>Communication is very important in the business world.  In working in the support desk, it can be frustrating when working with end users.  Today I decided to send off an email to my team restating an issue that is being reported by a particular department.  And I must say, I had fun writing this sentence:</p>
<blockquote><p>
They made note that there is a constant issue that continues to occur on a regular basis that is intermittent and sporadic.
</p></blockquote>
