So I'm having a slight issue with this server.  It uses a 100Mbit connection between a switch and a seperate router.  The connectivity between two directly connected systems, transferring a file seems to stick below a transfer rate of only 6KB/sec.  I honestly don't think this is an issue with my server though.  When the server is located at a different location, transfer rates appear normal. Downloading a file of a couple hundred megabytes only takes minutes rather than hours.  But here,  I don't know what is holding it back.

Then again, I also don't have access to the hardware in which all this stuff is connected too.  So maybe I'm screwed.  But a solution will soon be in place.  The plan will soon to be put a network card in an older computer.  And leave that computer at a different location.  That computer will serve as the location of the server permanently.  The only thing that i need to worry about, is the lack of managment to the server locally. As I will be 5 hours away from it.

So soon.  Sometime late December my server will be once again placed on a different physical machine.  And at a new location.  It will still be, once again, used for hosting this ugly blog and be some way of testing stuff.  Remotely.  MMMMmmmmm internet.
