<p>I created a small powershell script to roll through all security groups in active directory.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, I find this difficult to google.  Plenty of results to find a list of what a member is of, but not many that would display list of groups with each user that is assigned to it!</p>
<p>It isn't pretty.  And by no means do I know powershell at all.  But it was pretty quick.  Note the read me! Enjoy.</p>
