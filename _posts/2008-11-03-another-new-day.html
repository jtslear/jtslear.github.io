<p>Yesterday I brought on-line a new server.  I took my old laptop and threw Debian Etch on it.  The same laptop that used to run windows Server and before that was and Ubuntu Desktop is now once again a server.  Running Folding at Home and apache as a web-server, I know intend to do some testing with VPN's and emails.  Something I haven't done much of in the past, I would like to add to my experience.  However right now I wish I could get a job and be able to flex my educational muscle that was being grown all these past years.  I still haven't figured out what I'd like to write for this blog.  So more random stuff will be posted.  I guess if I have any troubles for my own personal diary.  I should use the word journal instead.</p>
<p>If you've noticed I have all my old posts that I had on my SQL database.  I backed all that up using the BlogXML export function that came with the .NET BlogEngine, then just copied and pasted the info into new posts here on WordPress.  Being that it was only a couple of posts it isn't that hard to do and probably the easiest.  I need to build up my list of tags and categories again, however.  I'll work on that eventually.  RIght now, I've got to get ready for an interview.</p>
<p>In the mean time, enjoy my fresh new looking blog.  Have a fantastic rainy day.</p>
