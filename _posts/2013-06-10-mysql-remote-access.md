So, I don't do this often enough, but when I do, I forget how to do it EVERYTIME. Â The below allows a specific user access to a specific database from a remote connection.

```
UPDATE db SET host='FQDN' WHERE db='database_name';
UPDATE user SET host='FQDN' WHERE user='user_name';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON database_name.* TO 'user_name'@'FQDN' IDENTIFIED BY 'the_password';
```

FQDN refers to the server that is making the connection to the database server.
