If you saw my last post I had some odd issue where transfer rates of information between anything and my server were tremendously slow.  Something i noticed on the switch in which the computer was plugged into, the link light wouldn't blink normally.  Normally being the random blip that all switches see as the uplink sends something too all connected to that switch.  What I did notice, is that the light would seemingly go out for a second, then return.  A constant blinking which got me thinking one thing.

After replacing the computer to a different port, all seems to be well.  So my assumption is that that port is just going bad on the switch.  To test that theory I plugged another machine just to see how bad I'm going to slow down someone elses computer.  Turns out, they aren't having that issue.  The link light blinks like any other light, and through the use of transferring data to that PC, there doesn't seem to be any sort of issue at all.  So what's the deal?

Just to go backwards a bit, I plugged my server back into that port once again.  And once again, that issue pops up.  Again.  So right now, I've reversed the ports so that the issue doesn't show for me.  Hopefully eventually that PC that is plugged into port two won't go down.  That would be a serious bummer.

Until my next post, have a fantastic evening.
